npx playwright-cli unroute
```

### DevTools

```bash
npx playwright-cli console
npx playwright-cli console warning
npx playwright-cli network
npx playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
npx playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
npx playwright-cli tracing-start
npx playwright-cli tracing-stop
npx playwright-cli video-start video.webm
npx playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
npx playwright-cli video-stop

# launch the dashboard with annotation prompt to ask the user for input
npx playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
npx playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style
npx playwright-cli highlight e5
npx playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
# hide a single element highlight, or all page highlights when no target is given
npx playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
npx playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
npx playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
npx playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
npx playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
npx playwright-cli click e5
npx playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(npx playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
npx playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
npx playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
npx playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
npx playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
npx playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
npx playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
npx playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
npx playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
npx playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
npx playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
npx playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
npx playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
npx playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
npx playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
npx playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
npx playwright-cli delete-data
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> npx playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
npx playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
npx playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
npx playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
npx playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
npx playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
npx playwright-cli snapshot --boxes
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
npx playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
npx playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
npx playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
npx playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
npx playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
npx playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

npx playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
npx playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
npx playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx playwright-cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright-cli --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx playwright-cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `playwright-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
npx playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
npx playwright-cli snapshot

npx playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
npx playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
npx playwright-cli click e3
npx playwright-cli snapshot
npx playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
npx playwright-cli open https://example.com
npx playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
npx playwright-cli tab-list
npx playwright-cli tab-select 0
npx playwright-cli snapshot
npx playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
npx playwright-cli open https://example.com
npx playwright-cli click e4
npx playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
npx playwright-cli console
npx playwright-cli network
npx playwright-cli close
```

```bash
npx playwright-cli open https://example.com
npx playwright-cli tracing-start
npx playwright-cli click e4
npx playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
npx playwright-cli tracing-stop
npx playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user to annotate the UI. User can provide contextual tasks or ask contextual questions using annotations:

```bash
npx playwright-cli open https://example.com
npx playwright-cli show --annotate
```
